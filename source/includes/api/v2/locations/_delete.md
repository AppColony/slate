`DELETE /api/public/v2/locations/<id>`

### HTTP Response Codes

404 | Cannot find location to delete. This could mean an incorrect ID or that this location was already deleted. 

### Asynchronous Operation

Please note that deleting a location is an asynchronous operation.

Getting a 202 response does not guarantee that this location was successfully deleted (although it will very likely succeed).
